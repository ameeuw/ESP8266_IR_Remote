# ESP8266_IR_Remote
Control a Mitsubishi HVAC by REST via a ESP8266.

This repository contains a script based on the irsend module found in the nodeMCU repo. It was modified to replicate the timing scheme for Mitsubishi HVACs. It is untested (only with an oscilloscope) since I moved to a different continent since living in Singapore (hence no HVAC needed anymore).
